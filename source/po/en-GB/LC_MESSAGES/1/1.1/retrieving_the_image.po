"Before you install Lubuntu, you need to retrieve the correct image. "
"Lubuntu offers two different kinds of images, Alternate and Desktop "
"images. Lubuntu also provides support for many different CPU "
"architectures. Lubuntu releases a new version every six months (supported"
" for nine (9) months), with every two years having a long term support "
"release (supported for three (3) or five (5) years, depending on the "
"release)."

"Alternate images are mainly intended for older, lower spec hardware and "
"uses a non-graphical installer. The desktop version offers a live session"
" to try out Lubuntu and make sure all of your hardware works before you "
"install it on your computer. The installer on the desktop is a graphical "
"installer where you can use a mouse and keyboard and it is more user "
"friendly, but this takes more resources than what is usually required to "
"run Lubuntu itself, due to the fact that the desktop image runs from your"
" RAM while Lubuntu normally runs from your hard drive. If your computer "
"has less than 512 MB of RAM it is recommended to use the alternate "
"installer as it will perform better with your system. The alternate "
"installer does not provide a live session so therefore it uses less RAM."
