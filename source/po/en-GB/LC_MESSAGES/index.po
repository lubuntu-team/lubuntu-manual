"The objective of the Lubuntu project is to create a variant of Ubuntu "
"that is lighter, less resource hungry and more energy-efficient by using "
"lightweight applications and LXDE, The Lightweight X11 Desktop "
"Environment, as its default GUI."

"Lubuntu is targeted at PC and laptop users running on low-spec hardware "
"that, in most cases, just doesn't have enough resources for all the bells"
" and whistles of the \"full-featured\" mainstream distributions. Members "
"of the team take care of LXDE and other packages that are part of "
"Lubuntu. Lubuntu received official recognition as a formal member of the "
"Ubuntu family, commencing with Lubuntu 11.10. Even though Lubuntu is a "
"lightweight distribution, it does not mean you will not be able to run "
"all applications that other distributions are currently offering. It does"
" mean that it is prepared and developed for low-specification computers. "
"Nonetheless, you can run any application available in the official "
"repositories, as long as your hardware can bear with it."
